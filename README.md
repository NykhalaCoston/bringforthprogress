# bringforthprogess

Things to do:

1. Create a Mission Statement:

statement draft 1:
To bring forth progress in Nepal with compassion, collaboration and disruption in education, healthcare and technology.

2. Work on source code for the website:

source code idea 1: 
We are going to try to use http://amaresimples.com.br for now. I have loaded the source code to my gitlab account and i am going to try to build this. Once it builds, I will upload here. I got source code from: https://github.com/massa1240/amar-e-simples .Hopefully this will work as wix is the last resort. 

3. Work on details to setup an NGO:

I guess this should be high priority for now. Will look at it tomorrow.

4. Setup a github wiki page:

This needs to be done as the readme file cannot keep up with for changing and longer information that doesnt really need to be on readme file. and I am guessing github provides a free wiki page like gitlab does for every repo.
